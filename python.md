READING / WRITING FILES
-----------------------

• close -- Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.

• read -- Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.

• readline -- Reads just one line of a text file.

• truncate -- Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.

• write('stuff') -- Writes "stuff" to the file.

• function check list:

• Did you start your function definition with def?

• Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?

• Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name?

• Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?

• Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?

• Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ): after the arguments?

• Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less.

• Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting we call it)?

When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:
 
•  Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?

• Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?

• Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?

• Did you end the function call with a ) character?
